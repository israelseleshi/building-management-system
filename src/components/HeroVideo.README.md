HeroVideo is a client-side background video component designed for the home hero section. Props: `youtubeUrl` (full YouTube URL or ID), `posterSrc` (path to poster image used on mobile and before the iframe loads, typically the existing hero background such as `/ethiopian-building.jpg`), `loopStart` (starting second for the looping segment, default 12), and `loopEnd` (ending second for the looping segment, default 22). The iframe is injected only in the browser via `IntersectionObserver` when the hero enters the viewport (threshold 0.25), with a 1s timeout fallback when `IntersectionObserver` is unavailable; mobile viewports (<=800px) hide the video and use only the poster, so the video file is not requested. To change the loop, update the `loopStart`/`loopEnd` props on `HeroVideo` (for example in the `/home` page hero) after picking a smooth segment in the YouTube player, then reload and verify that the background loops over the desired time range.
